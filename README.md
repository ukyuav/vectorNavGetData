# vectorNavGetData
Custom program for sampling data from an INS. Originally intended for VectorNav VN-300 onboard a UAV

Replaced in July 2018 with [BC5-datalogger](https://github.com/ukyuav/BC5-datalogger/), a version that combines this program with [mccGetData](https://github.com/ukyuav/mccGetData) and runs on a Raspberry Pi.
